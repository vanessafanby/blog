snippet: Storyboard of cartoon and self portrait video

I’ve decided to create a 3 storyboards from the movie Frozen (Let it Go). The time was from 1:03 to 1:12. To add on, I’ve included 3 screenshots of my footage that I took, which is showing the audience ‘sunset’ in different settings. I first started off my bending down to pick up a ‘gold coin’, symbolising  the sun(close up shot) in the next scene. All 3 are continuity scenes since there’s a narrative flow between the shots. Furthermore, the last two scenes are a match cut, contrasting different settings but still presenting ‘sunset’. This also evokes a sense of peace and calmness.
