Hello, world!

Today is my first day at RMIT digital media. I meet lots of new friends including Silvia, Julie and Juliet. I was in a group with Oscar and Zoe for scavenger hunt, we had a tough time finding places and items.

We went to the library found this book in 720?

A group friendly directed us to the cafe "Little Bang"

This door just genuinely looks like a door for the condemned.

We couldn’t find the dispensing machine, so we took a picture of the fridge outside the tuck shop

We finally found the study space!! YAYYYY!! However, there wasn’t enough time to go to other places.
