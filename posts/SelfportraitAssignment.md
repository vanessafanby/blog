My self portrait video starts off with a introduction to my hobby, creating an engaging opening shot that captures the audience's interest. By using PremierePro, I edited together my interests shots of me having fun in snowboarding, showcasing my passion. 

To add on, transitioning between the scenery of snowboarding and the shots of travelling around was a big challenge for me. To solve this problem, I included Google Maps as a helpful tool to transit in places.
