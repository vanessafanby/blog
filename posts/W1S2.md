I combined my train video with Silvia’s video in an alley. I thought that it’ll be a good idea to make the train appear first, since it gives the audience an idea that we’re going to a destination, which is the cafe. Furthermore, I’ve decided to use dissolving and fading to black as the transition in order to make the scenes smooth, and signify a change of location. I think I did quite a good job!
