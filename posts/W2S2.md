I’ve sound edited ‘Alone’ by Rocky, Jamie, Anna and Eva. I’ve used two websites in total, Freesound and ProSound Effects.

In my self portrait, there were snowboarding and travelling scenes that I’l depend upon. E.g juxtaposition of coin with sunset. 

I’m deciding to use a match cut shot to transit from one to another. Creating a smooth and aesthetic contrast. The juxtaposition of the golden circular coin with the round shape of the sun, creates a fascinating transition. Since this is a calm and relaxing scene, I’m planning on choosing a soft instrumental music instrument as my soundtrack. As an example: piano, flute, violin or maybe even a harp. Although it starts with a funny scene at the start, I’m still aiming to keep the overall video soothing and peaceful, with soft and gentle music. In order to keep the video calm, I’m going to use slow pacing, steady camera movements and peaceful locations. This allows the viewer to perceive a harmonious visual flow that enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the scene. Furthermore, the rhythm and beat should be in slow and gentle pace, matching to the movement of the camera during the scenery transition. 

*Change of mind
I'm using adventurous music instead of gentle music since my first few shots are stimulating. If I transfer from adventorous music to soft, it'll be a little awkward. Therefore, I'm focusing on letting the audience feel amazed by the scenery and the fun of snowboarding.
