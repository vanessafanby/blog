The video starts off with my favourite hobby, followed by shots of me travelling around, with beautiful sceneries. I found it quite changing transiting from snowboarding to travelling, therefore I’ve decided to use panning in to google maps and out to change locations. 

Introduction - By entering different locations in google, it gives the viewer an idea of what my interest is and where I’ll be taking them. Followed with different shots of snow mountain and vast landscape, it sets the stage for adventure and exploration.
